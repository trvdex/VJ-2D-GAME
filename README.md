# VJ-2D-GAME

VJ-2D-GAME is a 2D platformer video game developed from scratch as part of the Videojocs (VJ) course at the Barcelona School of Informatics (FIB, UPC).

## Description

This project is a faithful recreation inspired by the original game *Whomp 'Em*, specifically replicating the jungle level. The gameplay mechanics, enemies, and level design from the jungle stage of the original game have been carefully recreated to offer a similar experience.

The game features classic 2D platformer mechanics such as running, jumping, and attacking with a spear, with attention to detail in replicating enemy behaviors, environmental obstacles, and level progression from the original.

## Project Contents

- Source code primarily written in C++ and C.
- Game assets including animations, sprites, and audio files.
- Documentation and demo files to help build and run the game.
- A playable executable named `Bubble.exe` is included in the `binari` folder for quick testing of the game.

## Technologies Used

- C++ for game logic and mechanics
- OpenGL or similar libraries for 2D graphics rendering

## How to Run

Compile the project using your preferred IDE or build system supporting C++ projects. Alternatively, run the provided `Bubble.exe` executable located in the `binari` folder to test the game directly.
